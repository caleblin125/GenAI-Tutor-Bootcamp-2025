And rightly so. The smart applications of AI enable organizations to improve, to scale, and to accelerate the decision-making process across most business functions, so as to work both more efficiently and more effectively. It can also open up new avenues and new revenue streams, providing the organization with an additional competitive edge. In short, many believe (as we do) that the enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions today are positioning themselves to be the global economic leaders of tomorrow. But the path to building an effective AI capability is not an easy one. There are many challenges to overcome. Challenges with the technology to develop platforms and solutions. With the people who will implement and manage that technology. With the data that fuels the technology. And with the processes that govern the whole of it. How do you harness the power inherent in AI, while avoiding any potential missteps? That’s where Google Cloud comes in. Our framework for AI adoption provides a guide to technology leaders who want to build an effective AI capability, one that enables them to leverage the power of AI to enhance and streamline their business, smoothly and smartly. The framework is informed by Google’s own evolution, innovation, and leadership in AI, including experience deploying AI in production through products such as Gmail and Google Photos. It is also inspired by many years of experience helping cloud customers1 — from startups to enterprises, in various industries — to solve complex challenges.2 1 Google Cloud Customer Voices Digital Book 2019. 2 Google Cloud named a leader in The Forrester New Wave™: Computer Vision Platforms, Q4 2019. Recent advances in technology are making AI more versatile — and all but indispensableWith Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, you’ll be able to create and evolve your own transformative AI capability. You’ll have a map for assessing where you are in the journey and where, at the end of it, you’d like to be. You’ll have a structure for building scalable AI capabilities to create better insights from big data with powerful algorithms across the entire business. With Google Cloud as your guide, the path to AI is considerably smoother. 2Executive summary Part 1: 4 The power of AI New ideas are brought to market daily — some from established companies equipped with industry experience and capital, some from new companies armed with new technologies and a desire to disrupt. What often bridges the gap between plans and outcomes is a company’s ability to effectively make data-driven decisions and execute at scale. This is precisely what artificial intelligence with machine learning (ML)3 1 can do for the companies that know how to take that information and use it well. Machine learning is particularly adept at finding patterns in complex datasets to solve complex problems, including perceptual tasks, such as visual perception and speech recognition. The use cases are both wide reaching and dynamic. Manufacturers, for example, are streamlining their capital expenses by implementing predictive maintenance. Financial institutions are enhancing their risk analysis. Retailers and media providers are personalizing their customer experience. And the travel industry is offering their customers dynamic pricing predictions. At the same time, academic and industrial advances in AI have resulted in better tooling, smarter algorithms, and more effective implementation techniques covering a wide range of use cases and datasets. These advances — combined with exponential gains in the cost of data storage, compute power, AI-centric hardware, and cloud computing — have democratized AI for industry in an unprecedented way. AI and ML are increasingly implicated in companies gaining a competitive edge, with direct and attributable business value. In a research study we conducted in partnership with MIT Technology Review,4 2 we found that the adoption of ML results in 2x more data-driven decisions, 5x faster decision-making, and 3x faster execution. Enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions are proven to be better positioned as future global economic leaders. By 2030, companies that fully absorb AI could double their cash flow.5 3 Machine learning truly is reshaping the marketplace. 3 Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. Machine learning is an effective way for building AI systems through automatically discovering useful patterns from data, rather than feeding human-writ- ten rules to the system. 4 Machine Learning: The New Proving Ground for Competitive Advantage. 5 Notes from the AI frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy, McKinsey & Company, September 2018.5 Leveraging the power of AI How do you structure your teams for success? How can you create, discover, share, and manage data assets? How can you leverage native cloud technologies to scale AI? How do you streamline the process of updating and monitoring your ML models in production? We have a solution for that. The AI maturity themes Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework is anchored in the familiar rubric of people, process, technology, and data. The interplay between these four key areas gives rise to six themes: Learn, Lead, Access, Scale, Automate, and Secure. These themes are foundational to the AI Adoption Framework. Figure 1: The AI maturity themes6 Each of the themes draws its character from the two areas it bridges: Learn concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire external talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners. What data and ML skill sets are required in the organization? What data science and engineering roles should be hired? To what extent do learning plans reflect business needs? What is the nature of the partnership with AI third parties? Lead concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross-functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. How are the teams structured? Do they have executive sponsorship and empowerment? How are AI projects budgeted, governed, assessed? Access concerns the extent to which your organization recognizes data management as a key element to enable AI and the degree to which data scientists can share, discover, and reuse data and other ML artifacts. How is the dataset created, curated, and annotated? Who owns the dataset? Is it discoverable and reusable? Can you share, reuse, and expand trained models, notebooks, and other ML components and solutions?7 Scale concerns the extent to which you use cloud-native ML services that scale with large amounts of data and large numbers of data processing and ML jobs, with reduced operational overhead. How are cloud-based services provisioned? Are they on demand or long- living? How is capacity for workloads allocated? Secure concerns the extent to which you understand and protect your data and ML services from unauthorized and inappropriate access, in addition to ensuring responsible and explainable AI. What controls are in place? What strategies govern the whole? How does an organization establish trust in its AI capabilities so that it is leveraged to drive business value? Automate concerns the extent to which you are able to deploy, execute, and operate technology for data processing and ML pipelines in production efficiently, frequently, and reliably. What triggers a process? How do you track data lineage? Are your pipelines fault tolerant and resumable? How do you manage logging, monitoring, and notifications? 8 The AI maturity phases Your readiness for success in adopting AI in your business is determined by your current business practices in each of these six themes. For each theme, those practices will fall into one of the following phases: Tactical: Simple use cases for AI are in place, but they are typically short-term and narrow. There may be no coherent plan with a strategy for building out to the future. The focus is on easy adoption, minimal disruption, and quick wins. Strategic: AI is now used to deliver sustainable business value for the organization, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production, leveraging both ready-to-use and custom models. A broader vision governs AI adoption. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a special few. Perception starts to move beyond the hype, becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. Transformational: AI plays a key role in the organization: stimulating innovation, supporting agility, and helping to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is continuous and encouraged. ML expertise has diffused across lines of business. There is a mechanism in place for scaling and promoting ML capabilities across the organization. 9 The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the AI maturity themes in light of the three phases, the result is the AI Maturity Scale. Self-motivated, isolated learning using online resources Third parties cover the skills gap in the organization No hiring for ML skills AI adoption driven by individual contributors “Heroic” project manager with team budget AI/ML link to business goals not always clear Hiring data science and ML skills Organizing structured and continuous training programs Strategic partner selected to provide consulting and specialized knowledge Creating a centralized cross- functional advanced analytics team to establish common ML patterns and practices Senior executive sponsorship and dedicated budget by C-level for innovative projects Aligning AI efforts with business objectives and priorities Learning by embedding data scientists to the business function teams Hiring data science and ML talent for innovation with industry expertise Partnering to innovate, co-create, and augment technical resources Endorsement and dedicated budget within each line of business Function-specific data science teams with domain expertise, in addition to the centralized advanced analytics team Innovation and research teams No asset sharing Isolated data islands Building a data lake Managing an enterprise data warehouse Defining and sharing a unified data model Centralized data and ML asset management Discovering, sharing, and reusing datasets and AI assets Standardized ML feature stores and datasets Encouraging contributions from across the organization10 Dedicated hardware for cost control Working with a limited number of small datasets Implementing private networks with primitive IAM accessed and managed by a dedicated team Ensuring privacy through sensitive data classification and obfuscation Enabling data protection through encryption Using a fully managed serverless data warehouse for ad hoc querying and data exploration Using fully managed serverless data services for ingestion and processing Using fully managed serverless ML services for training and prediction serving Implementing principle of least privilege Exploring explainable AI techniques Investing in establishing AI ethics Operating an integrated ML experimentation and production platform Using specialized ML accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) on demand Orchestrating end-to-end data and ML pipelines IAM continuously monitored and improved Considering AI safety and robustness Developing fair ML systems Ad hoc, manual data processing and ML model training and serving High-risk changes reviewed and deployed infrequently and manually Automating (scheduled and event-driven) data pipelines Automating ML training and batch-prediction pipelines Managing logging, monitoring, and notifications Implementing ML training pipelines with continuous integration and delivery Implementing ML prediction services with continuous integration and delivery Managing ML model registry, ML metadata, and ML artifacts11 In each of the themes, you can see what happens when you move from adopting AI approaches ad hoc, to working with them more and more comprehensively across the organization — which means deeper and more consistent training for your people, which in turn means streamlined and updated processes, which in turn drives collaboration and, in time, innovation. The organization transforms. When AI has been integrated into all parts of your organization, then you are fully harnessing the power it offers to transform your position in the industry. But at every step along the way, adding in effective AI capabilities brings benefits. Putting it all together And that’s the essence of the framework that Google Cloud uses to guide customers successfully through the process of adopting AI in their organization. With the framework, you can assess your organization’s AI maturity and determine what you’ll need to bridge the gap to where you’d like to be. While we touch on the Google Cloud products, you can use this information however you would like: the framework is technology agnostic.', \"Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework Contents Creating value through AI, every step of the way Part 1: Executive summary The power of AI ................................................................................................................... 4 Leveraging the power of AI ............................................................................................. 5 The AI maturity themes The AI maturity phases The AI Maturity Scale Putting it all together Next steps ........................................................................................................................... 12 Find out more Work with Google experts Part 2: Technical deep-dive The AI maturity phases ................................................................................................... 14 Tactical Strategic Transformational The AI Maturity Scale ...................................................................................................... 20 Learn Lead Access Scale Secure Automate Additional technical resources .................................................................................... 351 Creating value through AI, every step of the way Companies everywhere are seeking to leverage the power of AI.

But at every step along the way, adding in effective AI capabilities brings benefits. Putting it all together And that’s the essence of the framework that Google Cloud uses to guide customers successfully through the process of adopting AI in their organization. With the framework, you can assess your organization’s AI maturity and determine what you’ll need to bridge the gap to where you’d like to be. While we touch on the Google Cloud products, you can use this information however you would like: the framework is technology agnostic. We’re here to offer further guidance, if that alignment dovetails with your vision. We’ve worked hard to make AI accessible to all, not only ML researchers and engineers, but to a vast array of customers across industries as well. And our ongoing work in tooling, frameworks, datasets, and models is well documented in the open source community. AI and ML are central to who we are. Whether or not we accompany you on the journey, however, our framework can help you find your way, from your initial changes all the way to becoming fully AI-powered. 12 Next steps Find out more To dive more deeply into the details of Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, see Part 2 of this paper.

Each organization’s current approaches to AI will fall within one of these three phases. Each phase offers opportunities for further exploration and development. Tactical Characteristics Organizations at the tactical phase are exploring the potential of AI to deliver in the short term. Use cases tend to be narrow, and developers are typically leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools and ready-to-use AI and ML services for proofs of concept and prototyping, for example, using a prebuilt computer vision service to detect printed and handwritten text, or using descriptive analytics to create a customer segmentation model. At this phase, organizations are aware of the promise of advanced analytics,6 1 but ML can be seen as unattainable, and for this reason, complex problems are outsourced. Since the ML projects that exist do so through individual efforts, those projects might not be aligned with the organization’s business goals, and so even the most successfully deployed ML projects may have only limited business impact. At this phase, too, there may be no process to scale solutions consistency, nor the skill set to solve complex analytics problems. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from better access to data. Integrated, cleaner, and fresher data leads, in turn, to actionable insights better tailored to your needs, which translates to sharper and more informed decision-making. Such swift improvement is immediately validating, and can help to paint a picture for stakeholders of the power of ML. 6 Broadly, we think of advanced analytics as the ability to use data science and machine learning to create insight for more effective decision-making. 15 Organizations at this phase should look to develop the foundational skill set for core data wrangling and descriptive analytics. To drive effective collaboration across an organization and to innovate with data from many sources, a key next move is to start bringing together siloed data from the many lines of business into a central, unified data lake, but with decentralized access. With a central data lake, it’s easier to derive insights from unstructured data and easier also to perform batch integration for reporting. Data is available through centralized tooling, but teams do not lose autonomy of access management or data ownership. Organizations at this phase can benefit, too, from the move toward use cases that are feasible and designed to deliver business value, but that begin to tackle increasingly complex problems. And the quality of the analytics solutions improves when the organization focuses on developing core standards: • A set of unified standards and technical practices that ensures the security of all data access and protection • A set of common principles and procedures that prevents building any ML that may harm your brand (such as, for example, inadvertently building socially biased models) Strategic Characteristics Organizations at the strategic phase are focused on delivering sustainable business value, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production that leverage both ready-to- use and custom models. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a select few, but is instead in the process of becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. At this phase, organizations typically require a degree of centralized coordination and so they will often create an advanced analytics7 1 team with the right skill set to build solutions for various ML use cases across business functions. This team can be part of a broader Cloud 7 A centralized team, spun out from the core Cloud COE. This team should have engineering skills in data, analytics, and ML; and they should operate as the hub in a hub-and-spoke pattern, working closely with other ML and data science teams in the various lines of business.16 Center of Excellence (COE),8 1 where engineers and data scientists with domain expertise work side by side, drawing on business subject matter experts, as required by the use case. The centralized team aims to achieve several strategic goals: • To ensure consistent standards and governance • To assess the feasibility of new use cases • To weigh in on new data collection • To remain current on which products can be bought rather than built • To help build ML solutions for different product teams • To prioritize scarce ML resources around key business problems As the surrounding organizational fabric matures (for example, increased awareness of AI capabilities, increasing demand for utilizing those capabilities, increased consistency of tooling and approach), it is more feasible for ML to be used independently in different products and business areas. At this phase, teams have skills in data wrangling and descriptive and predictive analytics; they use existing frameworks, methods, and techniques to solve a variety of use cases; and they often deploy custom ML models in production. Teams retrieve their information from a single source: an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), with complete, consistent, correct, and concurrent data. Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) routines are automated and scalable. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from developing an AI capability that is more tailored to their business model and their distinct business needs. And from adding automated processes to their customized models. Technically, the next key moves are about protecting data quality, preventing ML models from going stale, and enabling valuable solutions to be production ready. In addition, common practices and guidelines are established for building secure, ethics-complaint AI solutions. 8 No two Cloud COEs are quite the same. Data science skills are an important part of the picture. However, as the level of maturity deepens and the focus of the Cloud COE evolves, it can make increasing sense to establish a distinct advanced analytics capability. You can read more about what makes an effective Cloud COE in this whitepaper.17 Organizationally, the centralized advanced analytics team with technical ML skills starts to work smoothly in conjunction with various functional teams with specialized domain expertise. Transformational Characteristics Organizations at the transformational phase are actively using AI to stimulate innovation, to support agility, and to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is ongoing. Models are built and deployed from a unified ML platform, making ML accessible to everyone in the organization. At this phase, organizations typically model a hybrid approach to AI, with functional or product-specific AI teams embedded into the broader product teams — supported by the advanced analytics team, which might become its own hub or center of excellence. The central team enables a mechanism for scaling and cultivating these capabilities across the organization: for example, implementing a mechanism for secondment or talent rotation, whereby business or product experts are immersed in ML techniques to learn hands-on. Over time, ML expertise diffuses across lines of business. The role of the centralized advanced analytics team becomes more confined to establishing common patterns and best practices and to providing standard tools and libraries for accelerating ML projects. By contrast, the data science teams embedded in product groups or lines of business are responsible for building their function-specific ML models. This division of responsibility drives consistency in building high-quality, technical solutions with real business impact. All teams are empowered through a platform that enables access to useful datasets, prepared features, reusable components, and trained models. That platform is supported by scalable and serverless compute for batch and online data ingestion and processing, distributed ML training and serving, access to databases with specialized storage and querying capabilities, and hardware accelerators. 18 Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from focusing on best practices, ensuring that AI practices are responsible, that they are based on sound principles, and that AI systems are safe and robust. The ML platform is supported with tools for continuous integration, continuous training, and continuous model serving and monitoring. Building and maintaining such a platform is a shared responsibility between ML and software engineers with skills in infrastructure, DevOps, and SRE. Organizations in this phase often assemble teams to conduct cutting-edge research and present at academic conferences and AI events. To do this, they focus their research and innovation in areas where they have unique capabilities, either in terms of domain understanding or data availability, so that they can build a sustainable advantage over time. Besides the competitive edge that such a sustainable advantage provides, the in-house research capabilities can add to an organization’s employee value proposition, becoming a point of differentiation to attract the best talent.19 Google Cloud smart analytics and AI Google Cloud offers a wide set of products that enable organizations to accelerate their AI journey, ranging from ready-to-use AI services to an integrated data science development environment for building custom solutions.

Tactical maturity Learning about data science and ML is self-motivated by a few members of your IT and data teams, using publicy available online resources. While this approach is useful for developing technical skills around AI and ML in general, the training courses don’t follow a planned learning path that is aligned with your organization's current and future needs. Meanwhile, a few members may be working on ML prototypes, but when faced with a compelling use case where ML is needed, your organization tends to turn to third-party consultants, rather than hiring to fill the skill set gaps in-house. Strategic maturity You’re starting to build greater AI capability in-house by hiring the required data science and ML engineering skills. As there are plenty of job titles and descriptions in the field of ML,9 1 your focus is on the skills and seniority levels that the organization needs. 9 For a breakdown of the top 10 role profiles needed in a data science team, see this article from Google’s Head of Decision Intelligence. The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the six AI maturity themes in terms of the three AI maturity phases — where each phase is descriptive of how a given organization is currently functioning in that theme — you get the AI Maturity Scale. In each of the themes, you can see what happens when an organization moves from experimenting with ML tools and technologies, to working with them more strategically, to building a transformational AI capability. Bridging People and Technology, “Learn” concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire outside talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners.21 To ensure that your team is well qualified to use the necessary tools and technology, you’re developing clear learning paths with certifications and aligning those paths with your organization’s priority use cases. You’ve recognized that the field of AI is constantly changing, and you keep up with those changes by following relevant events, conferences, and experts in the field. You strive to do this systematically, providing employees with training opportunities and requirements to fulfill. In addition, you choose a strategic partner for advisory, consultation, and program management, someone who also provides specialized knowledge in specific AI and ML use cases (for example, chatbots and conversational apps). You use partnerships to help accelerate your AI adoption by taking advantage of best practices and other organizational lessons that experienced AI and ML subject matter experts bring to the table. Transformational maturity You aim to head-hunt well-known AI and ML talent to lead increasing research and innovation efforts — while also gaining a greater reputation for effective talent development. Both industry expertise (like finance, healthcare, telco) and domain expertise (churn prediction, credit risk assessment, medical diagnostics) become increasingly important for hiring great candidates. This talent and experience is essential for solving groundbreaking domain- specific problems with AI. For learning and development, you encourage peer-to-peer and community learning, creating an internal knowledge base, wikis, and tailored courses and learning tracks. You also organize internal conferences to showcase AI applications and promote knowledge sharing. Enabling rotations across business functions ensures not only tighter collaboration between members of different teams, but also an exchange of experience and learning on the job. This mechanism for diffusing and developing talent across your organization can become part of your employee value proposition, helping to attract the best talent. This can, in turn, help start a virtuous talent cycle. At this maturity phase, a partnership can evolve to become a co-creation relationship, where both you and your partners' ML researchers and engineers work together to break new ground and solve cutting-edge problems in the field. Such research also becomes part of your value proposition for employees, and a competitive advantage in the market.22 Lead An organization’s maturity in the Lead theme reflects the effectiveness with which that organization will adopt AI in line with business priorities. Tactical maturity AI adoption is driven across your organization by individual contributors or a manager within one project team, with little or no executive sponsorship. There is typically limited collaboration between data scientists in different teams, and there is often an unclear line of sight between ML initiatives and the organization’s strategic goals. You’re identifying the right use cases for applying ML and also pursuing executive sponsorship. The focus is to explore the power and prove the value of ML to stakeholders, while the funding is part of the project team’s budget. Bridging People and Process, “Lead” concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross- functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. The first successful use case The first step to realizing value from AI is to identify the right business problem and a sponsor committed to using AI to solve that problem. To ensure alignment, start with your organization’s business strategy and key priorities. Identify the right business priority use cases to address with AI, and find the senior executive to own it. Work with their team to get their buy-in and sponsorship. AI projects are more likely to be successful when they have a senior executive sponsor who will champion them with other leaders in your organization.23 Strategic maturity Your senior executives support AI capabilities and projects to deliver value to several business functions, an approach that amounts to a competitive advantage. You’ve begun to establish a mechanism for standardizing practices and guidelines and sharing accumulated knowledge. To accomplish this, you may have put into place a centralized advanced analytics team, with a dedicated budget established by a set of C-level executives with a technology agenda. The advanced analytics team works on delivering prioritized projects or short-term consulting to other teams. In addition, they proactively evangelize and advocate their AI capabilities to other lines of business, clarifying how AI can address the various use cases. What members of this team all share is a forward-thinking and self-motivated interest in using AI to deliver business value. Equally important, they share an understanding of the importance of scaling this impact by growing and embedding data science capabilities in functional teams across the business. Transformational maturity Each functional team has its own data scientists with the right domain-specific expertise and support from a technical project manager with the right organizational influence. This ensures that models can be successfully deployed and scaled in a timely manner. This team is supported by a centralized advanced analytics team, which provides standards and best practices, as well as the tooling and platform for implementing ML projects. Having both a centralized team and embedded data scientists in the business functions ensures technical standards and business alignment, respectively. With standards firmly in place, and the structure to support further investigation, research and innovation activities flourish. This work is sponsored by senior executives both to solve cutting-edge business problems and to establish the organization’s name as a market leader.\", \"Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework Contents Creating value through AI, every step of the way Part 1: Executive summary The power of AI ................................................................................................................... 4 Leveraging the power of AI ............................................................................................. 5 The AI maturity themes The AI maturity phases The AI Maturity Scale Putting it all together Next steps ........................................................................................................................... 12 Find out more Work with Google experts Part 2: Technical deep-dive The AI maturity phases ................................................................................................... 14 Tactical Strategic Transformational The AI Maturity Scale ...................................................................................................... 20 Learn Lead Access Scale Secure Automate Additional technical resources .................................................................................... 351 Creating value through AI, every step of the way Companies everywhere are seeking to leverage the power of AI. And rightly so. The smart applications of AI enable organizations to improve, to scale, and to accelerate the decision-making process across most business functions, so as to work both more efficiently and more effectively. It can also open up new avenues and new revenue streams, providing the organization with an additional competitive edge. In short, many believe (as we do) that the enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions today are positioning themselves to be the global economic leaders of tomorrow. But the path to building an effective AI capability is not an easy one. There are many challenges to overcome. Challenges with the technology to develop platforms and solutions. With the people who will implement and manage that technology. With the data that fuels the technology. And with the processes that govern the whole of it. How do you harness the power inherent in AI, while avoiding any potential missteps? That’s where Google Cloud comes in. Our framework for AI adoption provides a guide to technology leaders who want to build an effective AI capability, one that enables them to leverage the power of AI to enhance and streamline their business, smoothly and smartly. The framework is informed by Google’s own evolution, innovation, and leadership in AI, including experience deploying AI in production through products such as Gmail and Google Photos. It is also inspired by many years of experience helping cloud customers1 — from startups to enterprises, in various industries — to solve complex challenges.2 1 Google Cloud Customer Voices Digital Book 2019. 2 Google Cloud named a leader in The Forrester New Wave™: Computer Vision Platforms, Q4 2019. Recent advances in technology are making AI more versatile — and all but indispensableWith Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, you’ll be able to create and evolve your own transformative AI capability. You’ll have a map for assessing where you are in the journey and where, at the end of it, you’d like to be. You’ll have a structure for building scalable AI capabilities to create better insights from big data with powerful algorithms across the entire business. With Google Cloud as your guide, the path to AI is considerably smoother. 2Executive summary Part 1: 4 The power of AI New ideas are brought to market daily — some from established companies equipped with industry experience and capital, some from new companies armed with new technologies and a desire to disrupt. What often bridges the gap between plans and outcomes is a company’s ability to effectively make data-driven decisions and execute at scale. This is precisely what artificial intelligence with machine learning (ML)3 1 can do for the companies that know how to take that information and use it well. Machine learning is particularly adept at finding patterns in complex datasets to solve complex problems, including perceptual tasks, such as visual perception and speech recognition. The use cases are both wide reaching and dynamic. Manufacturers, for example, are streamlining their capital expenses by implementing predictive maintenance. Financial institutions are enhancing their risk analysis. Retailers and media providers are personalizing their customer experience. And the travel industry is offering their customers dynamic pricing predictions. At the same time, academic and industrial advances in AI have resulted in better tooling, smarter algorithms, and more effective implementation techniques covering a wide range of use cases and datasets. These advances — combined with exponential gains in the cost of data storage, compute power, AI-centric hardware, and cloud computing — have democratized AI for industry in an unprecedented way. AI and ML are increasingly implicated in companies gaining a competitive edge, with direct and attributable business value. In a research study we conducted in partnership with MIT Technology Review,4 2 we found that the adoption of ML results in 2x more data-driven decisions, 5x faster decision-making, and 3x faster execution. Enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions are proven to be better positioned as future global economic leaders. By 2030, companies that fully absorb AI could double their cash flow.5 3 Machine learning truly is reshaping the marketplace. 3 Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. Machine learning is an effective way for building AI systems through automatically discovering useful patterns from data, rather than feeding human-writ- ten rules to the system. 4 Machine Learning: The New Proving Ground for Competitive Advantage. 5 Notes from the AI frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy, McKinsey & Company, September 2018.5 Leveraging the power of AI How do you structure your teams for success? How can you create, discover, share, and manage data assets? How can you leverage native cloud technologies to scale AI? How do you streamline the process of updating and monitoring your ML models in production? We have a solution for that. The AI maturity themes Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework is anchored in the familiar rubric of people, process, technology, and data. The interplay between these four key areas gives rise to six themes: Learn, Lead, Access, Scale, Automate, and Secure. These themes are foundational to the AI Adoption Framework. Figure 1: The AI maturity themes6 Each of the themes draws its character from the two areas it bridges: Learn concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire external talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners. What data and ML skill sets are required in the organization? What data science and engineering roles should be hired? To what extent do learning plans reflect business needs? What is the nature of the partnership with AI third parties? Lead concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross-functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. How are the teams structured? Do they have executive sponsorship and empowerment? How are AI projects budgeted, governed, assessed? Access concerns the extent to which your organization recognizes data management as a key element to enable AI and the degree to which data scientists can share, discover, and reuse data and other ML artifacts. How is the dataset created, curated, and annotated? Who owns the dataset? Is it discoverable and reusable? Can you share, reuse, and expand trained models, notebooks, and other ML components and solutions?7 Scale concerns the extent to which you use cloud-native ML services that scale with large amounts of data and large numbers of data processing and ML jobs, with reduced operational overhead. How are cloud-based services provisioned? Are they on demand or long- living? How is capacity for workloads allocated? Secure concerns the extent to which you understand and protect your data and ML services from unauthorized and inappropriate access, in addition to ensuring responsible and explainable AI. What controls are in place? What strategies govern the whole? How does an organization establish trust in its AI capabilities so that it is leveraged to drive business value? Automate concerns the extent to which you are able to deploy, execute, and operate technology for data processing and ML pipelines in production efficiently, frequently, and reliably. What triggers a process? How do you track data lineage? Are your pipelines fault tolerant and resumable? How do you manage logging, monitoring, and notifications? 8 The AI maturity phases Your readiness for success in adopting AI in your business is determined by your current business practices in each of these six themes. For each theme, those practices will fall into one of the following phases: Tactical: Simple use cases for AI are in place, but they are typically short-term and narrow. There may be no coherent plan with a strategy for building out to the future. The focus is on easy adoption, minimal disruption, and quick wins. Strategic: AI is now used to deliver sustainable business value for the organization, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production, leveraging both ready-to-use and custom models. A broader vision governs AI adoption. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a special few. Perception starts to move beyond the hype, becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. Transformational: AI plays a key role in the organization: stimulating innovation, supporting agility, and helping to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is continuous and encouraged. ML expertise has diffused across lines of business. There is a mechanism in place for scaling and promoting ML capabilities across the organization. 9 The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the AI maturity themes in light of the three phases, the result is the AI Maturity Scale. Self-motivated, isolated learning using online resources Third parties cover the skills gap in the organization No hiring for ML skills AI adoption driven by individual contributors “Heroic” project manager with team budget AI/ML link to business goals not always clear Hiring data science and ML skills Organizing structured and continuous training programs Strategic partner selected to provide consulting and specialized knowledge Creating a centralized cross- functional advanced analytics team to establish common ML patterns and practices Senior executive sponsorship and dedicated budget by C-level for innovative projects Aligning AI efforts with business objectives and priorities Learning by embedding data scientists to the business function teams Hiring data science and ML talent for innovation with industry expertise Partnering to innovate, co-create, and augment technical resources Endorsement and dedicated budget within each line of business Function-specific data science teams with domain expertise, in addition to the centralized advanced analytics team Innovation and research teams No asset sharing Isolated data islands Building a data lake Managing an enterprise data warehouse Defining and sharing a unified data model Centralized data and ML asset management Discovering, sharing, and reusing datasets and AI assets Standardized ML feature stores and datasets Encouraging contributions from across the organization10 Dedicated hardware for cost control Working with a limited number of small datasets Implementing private networks with primitive IAM accessed and managed by a dedicated team Ensuring privacy through sensitive data classification and obfuscation Enabling data protection through encryption Using a fully managed serverless data warehouse for ad hoc querying and data exploration Using fully managed serverless data services for ingestion and processing Using fully managed serverless ML services for training and prediction serving Implementing principle of least privilege Exploring explainable AI techniques Investing in establishing AI ethics Operating an integrated ML experimentation and production platform Using specialized ML accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) on demand Orchestrating end-to-end data and ML pipelines IAM continuously monitored and improved Considering AI safety and robustness Developing fair ML systems Ad hoc, manual data processing and ML model training and serving High-risk changes reviewed and deployed infrequently and manually Automating (scheduled and event-driven) data pipelines Automating ML training and batch-prediction pipelines Managing logging, monitoring, and notifications Implementing ML training pipelines with continuous integration and delivery Implementing ML prediction services with continuous integration and delivery Managing ML model registry, ML metadata, and ML artifacts11 In each of the themes, you can see what happens when you move from adopting AI approaches ad hoc, to working with them more and more comprehensively across the organization — which means deeper and more consistent training for your people, which in turn means streamlined and updated processes, which in turn drives collaboration and, in time, innovation. The organization transforms. When AI has been integrated into all parts of your organization, then you are fully harnessing the power it offers to transform your position in the industry. But at every step along the way, adding in effective AI capabilities brings benefits. Putting it all together And that’s the essence of the framework that Google Cloud uses to guide customers successfully through the process of adopting AI in their organization. With the framework, you can assess your organization’s AI maturity and determine what you’ll need to bridge the gap to where you’d like to be. While we touch on the Google Cloud products, you can use this information however you would like: the framework is technology agnostic. We’re here to offer further guidance, if that alignment dovetails with your vision. We’ve worked hard to make AI accessible to all, not only ML researchers and engineers, but to a vast array of customers across industries as well. And our ongoing work in tooling, frameworks, datasets, and models is well documented in the open source community. AI and ML are central to who we are. Whether or not we accompany you on the journey, however, our framework can help you find your way, from your initial changes all the way to becoming fully AI-powered. 12 Next steps Find out more To dive more deeply into the details of Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, see Part 2 of this paper.

Each organization’s current approaches to AI will fall within one of these three phases. Each phase offers opportunities for further exploration and development. Tactical Characteristics Organizations at the tactical phase are exploring the potential of AI to deliver in the short term. Use cases tend to be narrow, and developers are typically leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools and ready-to-use AI and ML services for proofs of concept and prototyping, for example, using a prebuilt computer vision service to detect printed and handwritten text, or using descriptive analytics to create a customer segmentation model. At this phase, organizations are aware of the promise of advanced analytics,6 1 but ML can be seen as unattainable, and for this reason, complex problems are outsourced. Since the ML projects that exist do so through individual efforts, those projects might not be aligned with the organization’s business goals, and so even the most successfully deployed ML projects may have only limited business impact. At this phase, too, there may be no process to scale solutions consistency, nor the skill set to solve complex analytics problems. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from better access to data. Integrated, cleaner, and fresher data leads, in turn, to actionable insights better tailored to your needs, which translates to sharper and more informed decision-making. Such swift improvement is immediately validating, and can help to paint a picture for stakeholders of the power of ML. 6 Broadly, we think of advanced analytics as the ability to use data science and machine learning to create insight for more effective decision-making. 15 Organizations at this phase should look to develop the foundational skill set for core data wrangling and descriptive analytics. To drive effective collaboration across an organization and to innovate with data from many sources, a key next move is to start bringing together siloed data from the many lines of business into a central, unified data lake, but with decentralized access. With a central data lake, it’s easier to derive insights from unstructured data and easier also to perform batch integration for reporting. Data is available through centralized tooling, but teams do not lose autonomy of access management or data ownership. Organizations at this phase can benefit, too, from the move toward use cases that are feasible and designed to deliver business value, but that begin to tackle increasingly complex problems. And the quality of the analytics solutions improves when the organization focuses on developing core standards: • A set of unified standards and technical practices that ensures the security of all data access and protection • A set of common principles and procedures that prevents building any ML that may harm your brand (such as, for example, inadvertently building socially biased models) Strategic Characteristics Organizations at the strategic phase are focused on delivering sustainable business value, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production that leverage both ready-to- use and custom models. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a select few, but is instead in the process of becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. At this phase, organizations typically require a degree of centralized coordination and so they will often create an advanced analytics7 1 team with the right skill set to build solutions for various ML use cases across business functions. This team can be part of a broader Cloud 7 A centralized team, spun out from the core Cloud COE. This team should have engineering skills in data, analytics, and ML; and they should operate as the hub in a hub-and-spoke pattern, working closely with other ML and data science teams in the various lines of business.16 Center of Excellence (COE),8 1 where engineers and data scientists with domain expertise work side by side, drawing on business subject matter experts, as required by the use case. The centralized team aims to achieve several strategic goals: • To ensure consistent standards and governance • To assess the feasibility of new use cases • To weigh in on new data collection • To remain current on which products can be bought rather than built • To help build ML solutions for different product teams • To prioritize scarce ML resources around key business problems As the surrounding organizational fabric matures (for example, increased awareness of AI capabilities, increasing demand for utilizing those capabilities, increased consistency of tooling and approach), it is more feasible for ML to be used independently in different products and business areas. At this phase, teams have skills in data wrangling and descriptive and predictive analytics; they use existing frameworks, methods, and techniques to solve a variety of use cases; and they often deploy custom ML models in production. Teams retrieve their information from a single source: an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), with complete, consistent, correct, and concurrent data. Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) routines are automated and scalable. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from developing an AI capability that is more tailored to their business model and their distinct business needs. And from adding automated processes to their customized models. Technically, the next key moves are about protecting data quality, preventing ML models from going stale, and enabling valuable solutions to be production ready. In addition, common practices and guidelines are established for building secure, ethics-complaint AI solutions. 8 No two Cloud COEs are quite the same. Data science skills are an important part of the picture. However, as the level of maturity deepens and the focus of the Cloud COE evolves, it can make increasing sense to establish a distinct advanced analytics capability. You can read more about what makes an effective Cloud COE in this whitepaper.17 Organizationally, the centralized advanced analytics team with technical ML skills starts to work smoothly in conjunction with various functional teams with specialized domain expertise. Transformational Characteristics Organizations at the transformational phase are actively using AI to stimulate innovation, to support agility, and to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is ongoing. Models are built and deployed from a unified ML platform, making ML accessible to everyone in the organization. At this phase, organizations typically model a hybrid approach to AI, with functional or product-specific AI teams embedded into the broader product teams — supported by the advanced analytics team, which might become its own hub or center of excellence. The central team enables a mechanism for scaling and cultivating these capabilities across the organization: for example, implementing a mechanism for secondment or talent rotation, whereby business or product experts are immersed in ML techniques to learn hands-on. Over time, ML expertise diffuses across lines of business. The role of the centralized advanced analytics team becomes more confined to establishing common patterns and best practices and to providing standard tools and libraries for accelerating ML projects. By contrast, the data science teams embedded in product groups or lines of business are responsible for building their function-specific ML models. This division of responsibility drives consistency in building high-quality, technical solutions with real business impact. All teams are empowered through a platform that enables access to useful datasets, prepared features, reusable components, and trained models. That platform is supported by scalable and serverless compute for batch and online data ingestion and processing, distributed ML training and serving, access to databases with specialized storage and querying capabilities, and hardware accelerators. 18 Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from focusing on best practices, ensuring that AI practices are responsible, that they are based on sound principles, and that AI systems are safe and robust. The ML platform is supported with tools for continuous integration, continuous training, and continuous model serving and monitoring. Building and maintaining such a platform is a shared responsibility between ML and software engineers with skills in infrastructure, DevOps, and SRE. Organizations in this phase often assemble teams to conduct cutting-edge research and present at academic conferences and AI events. To do this, they focus their research and innovation in areas where they have unique capabilities, either in terms of domain understanding or data availability, so that they can build a sustainable advantage over time. Besides the competitive edge that such a sustainable advantage provides, the in-house research capabilities can add to an organization’s employee value proposition, becoming a point of differentiation to attract the best talent.19 Google Cloud smart analytics and AI Google Cloud offers a wide set of products that enable organizations to accelerate their AI journey, ranging from ready-to-use AI services to an integrated data science development environment for building custom solutions.

Tactical maturity Learning about data science and ML is self-motivated by a few members of your IT and data teams, using publicy available online resources. While this approach is useful for developing technical skills around AI and ML in general, the training courses don’t follow a planned learning path that is aligned with your organization's current and future needs. Meanwhile, a few members may be working on ML prototypes, but when faced with a compelling use case where ML is needed, your organization tends to turn to third-party consultants, rather than hiring to fill the skill set gaps in-house. Strategic maturity You’re starting to build greater AI capability in-house by hiring the required data science and ML engineering skills. As there are plenty of job titles and descriptions in the field of ML,9 1 your focus is on the skills and seniority levels that the organization needs. 9 For a breakdown of the top 10 role profiles needed in a data science team, see this article from Google’s Head of Decision Intelligence. The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the six AI maturity themes in terms of the three AI maturity phases — where each phase is descriptive of how a given organization is currently functioning in that theme — you get the AI Maturity Scale. In each of the themes, you can see what happens when an organization moves from experimenting with ML tools and technologies, to working with them more strategically, to building a transformational AI capability. Bridging People and Technology, “Learn” concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire outside talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners.21 To ensure that your team is well qualified to use the necessary tools and technology, you’re developing clear learning paths with certifications and aligning those paths with your organization’s priority use cases. You’ve recognized that the field of AI is constantly changing, and you keep up with those changes by following relevant events, conferences, and experts in the field. You strive to do this systematically, providing employees with training opportunities and requirements to fulfill. In addition, you choose a strategic partner for advisory, consultation, and program management, someone who also provides specialized knowledge in specific AI and ML use cases (for example, chatbots and conversational apps). You use partnerships to help accelerate your AI adoption by taking advantage of best practices and other organizational lessons that experienced AI and ML subject matter experts bring to the table. Transformational maturity You aim to head-hunt well-known AI and ML talent to lead increasing research and innovation efforts — while also gaining a greater reputation for effective talent development. Both industry expertise (like finance, healthcare, telco) and domain expertise (churn prediction, credit risk assessment, medical diagnostics) become increasingly important for hiring great candidates. This talent and experience is essential for solving groundbreaking domain- specific problems with AI. For learning and development, you encourage peer-to-peer and community learning, creating an internal knowledge base, wikis, and tailored courses and learning tracks. You also organize internal conferences to showcase AI applications and promote knowledge sharing. Enabling rotations across business functions ensures not only tighter collaboration between members of different teams, but also an exchange of experience and learning on the job. This mechanism for diffusing and developing talent across your organization can become part of your employee value proposition, helping to attract the best talent. This can, in turn, help start a virtuous talent cycle. At this maturity phase, a partnership can evolve to become a co-creation relationship, where both you and your partners' ML researchers and engineers work together to break new ground and solve cutting-edge problems in the field. Such research also becomes part of your value proposition for employees, and a competitive advantage in the market.22 Lead An organization’s maturity in the Lead theme reflects the effectiveness with which that organization will adopt AI in line with business priorities. Tactical maturity AI adoption is driven across your organization by individual contributors or a manager within one project team, with little or no executive sponsorship. There is typically limited collaboration between data scientists in different teams, and there is often an unclear line of sight between ML initiatives and the organization’s strategic goals. You’re identifying the right use cases for applying ML and also pursuing executive sponsorship. The focus is to explore the power and prove the value of ML to stakeholders, while the funding is part of the project team’s budget. Bridging People and Process, “Lead” concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross- functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. The first successful use case The first step to realizing value from AI is to identify the right business problem and a sponsor committed to using AI to solve that problem. To ensure alignment, start with your organization’s business strategy and key priorities. Identify the right business priority use cases to address with AI, and find the senior executive to own it. Work with their team to get their buy-in and sponsorship. AI projects are more likely to be successful when they have a senior executive sponsor who will champion them with other leaders in your organization.23 Strategic maturity Your senior executives support AI capabilities and projects to deliver value to several business functions, an approach that amounts to a competitive advantage. You’ve begun to establish a mechanism for standardizing practices and guidelines and sharing accumulated knowledge. To accomplish this, you may have put into place a centralized advanced analytics team, with a dedicated budget established by a set of C-level executives with a technology agenda. The advanced analytics team works on delivering prioritized projects or short-term consulting to other teams. In addition, they proactively evangelize and advocate their AI capabilities to other lines of business, clarifying how AI can address the various use cases. What members of this team all share is a forward-thinking and self-motivated interest in using AI to deliver business value. Equally important, they share an understanding of the importance of scaling this impact by growing and embedding data science capabilities in functional teams across the business. Transformational maturity Each functional team has its own data scientists with the right domain-specific expertise and support from a technical project manager with the right organizational influence. This ensures that models can be successfully deployed and scaled in a timely manner. This team is supported by a centralized advanced analytics team, which provides standards and best practices, as well as the tooling and platform for implementing ML projects. Having both a centralized team and embedded data scientists in the business functions ensures technical standards and business alignment, respectively. With standards firmly in place, and the structure to support further investigation, research and innovation activities flourish. This work is sponsored by senior executives both to solve cutting-edge business problems and to establish the organization’s name as a market leader. In addition, to stimulate innovation, you facilitate competitions that reward employees for sharing ideas on how ML can solve key problems.24 Your C-level executives act passionately, continuously demonstrating active sponsorship for AI projects and encouraging contributions from across the organization. The leadership functions effectively for an AI-driven environment, fostering a culture of blamelessness and open communication channels, where sharing failures openly is encouraged and mistakes are treated as opportunities for improvement. Experimentation drives innovation and market success. Teams are free to try out many different ideas with the goal of failing faster, failing better, and learning from the experience to improve and innovate. Access An organization’s maturity in the Access theme reflects that organization’s ability both to accelerate an ML project and to improve the adoption of the AI capabilities across different teams and functions. Tactical maturity Each team usually manages its own data island and ML assets,10 1 with no sharing among other teams. Even within the same team, it might not be possible to reuse assets, as the technology and processes have not been standardized yet. In a bid to update your data management and access strategy, you are looking into building a unified data lake, containing the raw (structured and unstructured) data feeds, for example, using Cloud Storage. This data lake can then form the foundation for collecting, curating, and sharing data across the organization, that is, for building managed information stores. Strategic maturity You recognize data as a vital enterprise asset that fuels AI, and so you’ve improved both the utilization and the management of data, working to keep it safe and useful. You likely have invested in an EDW, which provides a unified data model, with an integrated, consistent information store for various business functions. You have also made data quality management a business priority to ensure the right foundation for analytics and AI. The EDW, which can be implemented using BigQuery, empowers data analysts in their reporting, data scientists in their exploratory data analysis and ML experimentation tasks, and other business intelligence (BI) activities.\"]\n","\n","Generated Answer: a + b + c is 0 when a, b and c are the roots of the equation x^3 - 2x^2 + x – 2 = 0.\n","Please enter your query: tell me what Google Cloud's AI Adoption Framework is\n","['Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework Contents Creating value through AI, every step of the way Part 1: Executive summary The power of AI ................................................................................................................... 4 Leveraging the power of AI ............................................................................................. 5 The AI maturity themes The AI maturity phases The AI Maturity Scale Putting it all together Next steps ........................................................................................................................... 12 Find out more Work with Google experts Part 2: Technical deep-dive The AI maturity phases ................................................................................................... 14 Tactical Strategic Transformational The AI Maturity Scale ...................................................................................................... 20 Learn Lead Access Scale Secure Automate Additional technical resources .................................................................................... 351 Creating value through AI, every step of the way Companies everywhere are seeking to leverage the power of AI. And rightly so. The smart applications of AI enable organizations to improve, to scale, and to accelerate the decision-making process across most business functions, so as to work both more efficiently and more effectively. It can also open up new avenues and new revenue streams, providing the organization with an additional competitive edge. In short, many believe (as we do) that the enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions today are positioning themselves to be the global economic leaders of tomorrow. But the path to building an effective AI capability is not an easy one. There are many challenges to overcome. Challenges with the technology to develop platforms and solutions. With the people who will implement and manage that technology. With the data that fuels the technology. And with the processes that govern the whole of it. How do you harness the power inherent in AI, while avoiding any potential missteps? That’s where Google Cloud comes in. Our framework for AI adoption provides a guide to technology leaders who want to build an effective AI capability, one that enables them to leverage the power of AI to enhance and streamline their business, smoothly and smartly. The framework is informed by Google’s own evolution, innovation, and leadership in AI, including experience deploying AI in production through products such as Gmail and Google Photos. It is also inspired by many years of experience helping cloud customers1 — from startups to enterprises, in various industries — to solve complex challenges.2 1 Google Cloud Customer Voices Digital Book 2019. 2 Google Cloud named a leader in The Forrester New Wave™: Computer Vision Platforms, Q4 2019. Recent advances in technology are making AI more versatile — and all but indispensableWith Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, you’ll be able to create and evolve your own transformative AI capability. You’ll have a map for assessing where you are in the journey and where, at the end of it, you’d like to be. You’ll have a structure for building scalable AI capabilities to create better insights from big data with powerful algorithms across the entire business. With Google Cloud as your guide, the path to AI is considerably smoother. 2Executive summary Part 1: 4 The power of AI New ideas are brought to market daily — some from established companies equipped with industry experience and capital, some from new companies armed with new technologies and a desire to disrupt. What often bridges the gap between plans and outcomes is a company’s ability to effectively make data-driven decisions and execute at scale. This is precisely what artificial intelligence with machine learning (ML)3 1 can do for the companies that know how to take that information and use it well. Machine learning is particularly adept at finding patterns in complex datasets to solve complex problems, including perceptual tasks, such as visual perception and speech recognition. The use cases are both wide reaching and dynamic. Manufacturers, for example, are streamlining their capital expenses by implementing predictive maintenance. Financial institutions are enhancing their risk analysis. Retailers and media providers are personalizing their customer experience. And the travel industry is offering their customers dynamic pricing predictions. At the same time, academic and industrial advances in AI have resulted in better tooling, smarter algorithms, and more effective implementation techniques covering a wide range of use cases and datasets. These advances — combined with exponential gains in the cost of data storage, compute power, AI-centric hardware, and cloud computing — have democratized AI for industry in an unprecedented way. AI and ML are increasingly implicated in companies gaining a competitive edge, with direct and attributable business value. In a research study we conducted in partnership with MIT Technology Review,4 2 we found that the adoption of ML results in 2x more data-driven decisions, 5x faster decision-making, and 3x faster execution. Enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions are proven to be better positioned as future global economic leaders. By 2030, companies that fully absorb AI could double their cash flow.5 3 Machine learning truly is reshaping the marketplace. 3 Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. Machine learning is an effective way for building AI systems through automatically discovering useful patterns from data, rather than feeding human-writ- ten rules to the system. 4 Machine Learning: The New Proving Ground for Competitive Advantage. 5 Notes from the AI frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy, McKinsey & Company, September 2018.5 Leveraging the power of AI How do you structure your teams for success? How can you create, discover, share, and manage data assets? How can you leverage native cloud technologies to scale AI? How do you streamline the process of updating and monitoring your ML models in production? We have a solution for that. The AI maturity themes Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework is anchored in the familiar rubric of people, process, technology, and data. The interplay between these four key areas gives rise to six themes: Learn, Lead, Access, Scale, Automate, and Secure. These themes are foundational to the AI Adoption Framework. Figure 1: The AI maturity themes6 Each of the themes draws its character from the two areas it bridges: Learn concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire external talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners. What data and ML skill sets are required in the organization? What data science and engineering roles should be hired? To what extent do learning plans reflect business needs? What is the nature of the partnership with AI third parties? Lead concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross-functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. How are the teams structured? Do they have executive sponsorship and empowerment? How are AI projects budgeted, governed, assessed? Access concerns the extent to which your organization recognizes data management as a key element to enable AI and the degree to which data scientists can share, discover, and reuse data and other ML artifacts. How is the dataset created, curated, and annotated? Who owns the dataset? Is it discoverable and reusable? Can you share, reuse, and expand trained models, notebooks, and other ML components and solutions?7 Scale concerns the extent to which you use cloud-native ML services that scale with large amounts of data and large numbers of data processing and ML jobs, with reduced operational overhead. How are cloud-based services provisioned? Are they on demand or long- living? How is capacity for workloads allocated? Secure concerns the extent to which you understand and protect your data and ML services from unauthorized and inappropriate access, in addition to ensuring responsible and explainable AI. What controls are in place? What strategies govern the whole? How does an organization establish trust in its AI capabilities so that it is leveraged to drive business value? Automate concerns the extent to which you are able to deploy, execute, and operate technology for data processing and ML pipelines in production efficiently, frequently, and reliably. What triggers a process? How do you track data lineage? Are your pipelines fault tolerant and resumable? How do you manage logging, monitoring, and notifications? 8 The AI maturity phases Your readiness for success in adopting AI in your business is determined by your current business practices in each of these six themes. For each theme, those practices will fall into one of the following phases: Tactical: Simple use cases for AI are in place, but they are typically short-term and narrow. There may be no coherent plan with a strategy for building out to the future. The focus is on easy adoption, minimal disruption, and quick wins. Strategic: AI is now used to deliver sustainable business value for the organization, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production, leveraging both ready-to-use and custom models. A broader vision governs AI adoption. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a special few. Perception starts to move beyond the hype, becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. Transformational: AI plays a key role in the organization: stimulating innovation, supporting agility, and helping to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is continuous and encouraged. ML expertise has diffused across lines of business. There is a mechanism in place for scaling and promoting ML capabilities across the organization. 9 The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the AI maturity themes in light of the three phases, the result is the AI Maturity Scale. Self-motivated, isolated learning using online resources Third parties cover the skills gap in the organization No hiring for ML skills AI adoption driven by individual contributors “Heroic” project manager with team budget AI/ML link to business goals not always clear Hiring data science and ML skills Organizing structured and continuous training programs Strategic partner selected to provide consulting and specialized knowledge Creating a centralized cross- functional advanced analytics team to establish common ML patterns and practices Senior executive sponsorship and dedicated budget by C-level for innovative projects Aligning AI efforts with business objectives and priorities Learning by embedding data scientists to the business function teams Hiring data science and ML talent for innovation with industry expertise Partnering to innovate, co-create, and augment technical resources Endorsement and dedicated budget within each line of business Function-specific data science teams with domain expertise, in addition to the centralized advanced analytics team Innovation and research teams No asset sharing Isolated data islands Building a data lake Managing an enterprise data warehouse Defining and sharing a unified data model Centralized data and ML asset management Discovering, sharing, and reusing datasets and AI assets Standardized ML feature stores and datasets Encouraging contributions from across the organization10 Dedicated hardware for cost control Working with a limited number of small datasets Implementing private networks with primitive IAM accessed and managed by a dedicated team Ensuring privacy through sensitive data classification and obfuscation Enabling data protection through encryption Using a fully managed serverless data warehouse for ad hoc querying and data exploration Using fully managed serverless data services for ingestion and processing Using fully managed serverless ML services for training and prediction serving Implementing principle of least privilege Exploring explainable AI techniques Investing in establishing AI ethics Operating an integrated ML experimentation and production platform Using specialized ML accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) on demand Orchestrating end-to-end data and ML pipelines IAM continuously monitored and improved Considering AI safety and robustness Developing fair ML systems Ad hoc, manual data processing and ML model training and serving High-risk changes reviewed and deployed infrequently and manually Automating (scheduled and event-driven) data pipelines Automating ML training and batch-prediction pipelines Managing logging, monitoring, and notifications Implementing ML training pipelines with continuous integration and delivery Implementing ML prediction services with continuous integration and delivery Managing ML model registry, ML metadata, and ML artifacts11 In each of the themes, you can see what happens when you move from adopting AI approaches ad hoc, to working with them more and more comprehensively across the organization — which means deeper and more consistent training for your people, which in turn means streamlined and updated processes, which in turn drives collaboration and, in time, innovation. The organization transforms. When AI has been integrated into all parts of your organization, then you are fully harnessing the power it offers to transform your position in the industry. But at every step along the way, adding in effective AI capabilities brings benefits. Putting it all together And that’s the essence of the framework that Google Cloud uses to guide customers successfully through the process of adopting AI in their organization. With the framework, you can assess your organization’s AI maturity and determine what you’ll need to bridge the gap to where you’d like to be. While we touch on the Google Cloud products, you can use this information however you would like: the framework is technology agnostic.', \"Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework Contents Creating value through AI, every step of the way Part 1: Executive summary The power of AI ................................................................................................................... 4 Leveraging the power of AI ............................................................................................. 5 The AI maturity themes The AI maturity phases The AI Maturity Scale Putting it all together Next steps ........................................................................................................................... 12 Find out more Work with Google experts Part 2: Technical deep-dive The AI maturity phases ................................................................................................... 14 Tactical Strategic Transformational The AI Maturity Scale ...................................................................................................... 20 Learn Lead Access Scale Secure Automate Additional technical resources .................................................................................... 351 Creating value through AI, every step of the way Companies everywhere are seeking to leverage the power of AI.

Access concerns the extent to which your organization recognizes data management as a key element to enable AI and the degree to which data scientists can share, discover, and reuse data and other ML artifacts. How is the dataset created, curated, and annotated? Who owns the dataset? Is it discoverable and reusable? Can you share, reuse, and expand trained models, notebooks, and other ML components and solutions?7 Scale concerns the extent to which you use cloud-native ML services that scale with large amounts of data and large numbers of data processing and ML jobs, with reduced operational overhead. How are cloud-based services provisioned? Are they on demand or long- living? How is capacity for workloads allocated? Secure concerns the extent to which you understand and protect your data and ML services from unauthorized and inappropriate access, in addition to ensuring responsible and explainable AI. What controls are in place? What strategies govern the whole? How does an organization establish trust in its AI capabilities so that it is leveraged to drive business value? Automate concerns the extent to which you are able to deploy, execute, and operate technology for data processing and ML pipelines in production efficiently, frequently, and reliably. What triggers a process? How do you track data lineage? Are your pipelines fault tolerant and resumable? How do you manage logging, monitoring, and notifications? 8 The AI maturity phases Your readiness for success in adopting AI in your business is determined by your current business practices in each of these six themes. For each theme, those practices will fall into one of the following phases: Tactical: Simple use cases for AI are in place, but they are typically short-term and narrow. There may be no coherent plan with a strategy for building out to the future. The focus is on easy adoption, minimal disruption, and quick wins. Strategic: AI is now used to deliver sustainable business value for the organization, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production, leveraging both ready-to-use and custom models. A broader vision governs AI adoption. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a special few. Perception starts to move beyond the hype, becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. Transformational: AI plays a key role in the organization: stimulating innovation, supporting agility, and helping to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is continuous and encouraged. ML expertise has diffused across lines of business. There is a mechanism in place for scaling and promoting ML capabilities across the organization. 9 The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the AI maturity themes in light of the three phases, the result is the AI Maturity Scale. Self-motivated, isolated learning using online resources Third parties cover the skills gap in the organization No hiring for ML skills AI adoption driven by individual contributors “Heroic” project manager with team budget AI/ML link to business goals not always clear Hiring data science and ML skills Organizing structured and continuous training programs Strategic partner selected to provide consulting and specialized knowledge Creating a centralized cross- functional advanced analytics team to establish common ML patterns and practices Senior executive sponsorship and dedicated budget by C-level for innovative projects Aligning AI efforts with business objectives and priorities Learning by embedding data scientists to the business function teams Hiring data science and ML talent for innovation with industry expertise Partnering to innovate, co-create, and augment technical resources Endorsement and dedicated budget within each line of business Function-specific data science teams with domain expertise, in addition to the centralized advanced analytics team Innovation and research teams No asset sharing Isolated data islands Building a data lake Managing an enterprise data warehouse Defining and sharing a unified data model Centralized data and ML asset management Discovering, sharing, and reusing datasets and AI assets Standardized ML feature stores and datasets Encouraging contributions from across the organization10 Dedicated hardware for cost control Working with a limited number of small datasets Implementing private networks with primitive IAM accessed and managed by a dedicated team Ensuring privacy through sensitive data classification and obfuscation Enabling data protection through encryption Using a fully managed serverless data warehouse for ad hoc querying and data exploration Using fully managed serverless data services for ingestion and processing Using fully managed serverless ML services for training and prediction serving Implementing principle of least privilege Exploring explainable AI techniques Investing in establishing AI ethics Operating an integrated ML experimentation and production platform Using specialized ML accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) on demand Orchestrating end-to-end data and ML pipelines IAM continuously monitored and improved Considering AI safety and robustness Developing fair ML systems Ad hoc, manual data processing and ML model training and serving High-risk changes reviewed and deployed infrequently and manually Automating (scheduled and event-driven) data pipelines Automating ML training and batch-prediction pipelines Managing logging, monitoring, and notifications Implementing ML training pipelines with continuous integration and delivery Implementing ML prediction services with continuous integration and delivery Managing ML model registry, ML metadata, and ML artifacts11 In each of the themes, you can see what happens when you move from adopting AI approaches ad hoc, to working with them more and more comprehensively across the organization — which means deeper and more consistent training for your people, which in turn means streamlined and updated processes, which in turn drives collaboration and, in time, innovation. The organization transforms. When AI has been integrated into all parts of your organization, then you are fully harnessing the power it offers to transform your position in the industry. But at every step along the way, adding in effective AI capabilities brings benefits. Putting it all together And that’s the essence of the framework that Google Cloud uses to guide customers successfully through the process of adopting AI in their organization. With the framework, you can assess your organization’s AI maturity and determine what you’ll need to bridge the gap to where you’d like to be. While we touch on the Google Cloud products, you can use this information however you would like: the framework is technology agnostic. We’re here to offer further guidance, if that alignment dovetails with your vision. We’ve worked hard to make AI accessible to all, not only ML researchers and engineers, but to a vast array of customers across industries as well. And our ongoing work in tooling, frameworks, datasets, and models is well documented in the open source community. AI and ML are central to who we are. Whether or not we accompany you on the journey, however, our framework can help you find your way, from your initial changes all the way to becoming fully AI-powered. 12 Next steps Find out more To dive more deeply into the details of Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, see Part 2 of this paper.

Each organization’s current approaches to AI will fall within one of these three phases. Each phase offers opportunities for further exploration and development. Tactical Characteristics Organizations at the tactical phase are exploring the potential of AI to deliver in the short term. Use cases tend to be narrow, and developers are typically leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools and ready-to-use AI and ML services for proofs of concept and prototyping, for example, using a prebuilt computer vision service to detect printed and handwritten text, or using descriptive analytics to create a customer segmentation model. At this phase, organizations are aware of the promise of advanced analytics,6 1 but ML can be seen as unattainable, and for this reason, complex problems are outsourced. Since the ML projects that exist do so through individual efforts, those projects might not be aligned with the organization’s business goals, and so even the most successfully deployed ML projects may have only limited business impact. At this phase, too, there may be no process to scale solutions consistency, nor the skill set to solve complex analytics problems. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from better access to data. Integrated, cleaner, and fresher data leads, in turn, to actionable insights better tailored to your needs, which translates to sharper and more informed decision-making. Such swift improvement is immediately validating, and can help to paint a picture for stakeholders of the power of ML. 6 Broadly, we think of advanced analytics as the ability to use data science and machine learning to create insight for more effective decision-making. 15 Organizations at this phase should look to develop the foundational skill set for core data wrangling and descriptive analytics. To drive effective collaboration across an organization and to innovate with data from many sources, a key next move is to start bringing together siloed data from the many lines of business into a central, unified data lake, but with decentralized access. With a central data lake, it’s easier to derive insights from unstructured data and easier also to perform batch integration for reporting. Data is available through centralized tooling, but teams do not lose autonomy of access management or data ownership. Organizations at this phase can benefit, too, from the move toward use cases that are feasible and designed to deliver business value, but that begin to tackle increasingly complex problems. And the quality of the analytics solutions improves when the organization focuses on developing core standards: • A set of unified standards and technical practices that ensures the security of all data access and protection • A set of common principles and procedures that prevents building any ML that may harm your brand (such as, for example, inadvertently building socially biased models) Strategic Characteristics Organizations at the strategic phase are focused on delivering sustainable business value, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production that leverage both ready-to- use and custom models. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a select few, but is instead in the process of becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. At this phase, organizations typically require a degree of centralized coordination and so they will often create an advanced analytics7 1 team with the right skill set to build solutions for various ML use cases across business functions. This team can be part of a broader Cloud 7 A centralized team, spun out from the core Cloud COE. This team should have engineering skills in data, analytics, and ML; and they should operate as the hub in a hub-and-spoke pattern, working closely with other ML and data science teams in the various lines of business.16 Center of Excellence (COE),8 1 where engineers and data scientists with domain expertise work side by side, drawing on business subject matter experts, as required by the use case. The centralized team aims to achieve several strategic goals: • To ensure consistent standards and governance • To assess the feasibility of new use cases • To weigh in on new data collection • To remain current on which products can be bought rather than built • To help build ML solutions for different product teams • To prioritize scarce ML resources around key business problems As the surrounding organizational fabric matures (for example, increased awareness of AI capabilities, increasing demand for utilizing those capabilities, increased consistency of tooling and approach), it is more feasible for ML to be used independently in different products and business areas. At this phase, teams have skills in data wrangling and descriptive and predictive analytics; they use existing frameworks, methods, and techniques to solve a variety of use cases; and they often deploy custom ML models in production. Teams retrieve their information from a single source: an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), with complete, consistent, correct, and concurrent data. Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) routines are automated and scalable. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from developing an AI capability that is more tailored to their business model and their distinct business needs. And from adding automated processes to their customized models. Technically, the next key moves are about protecting data quality, preventing ML models from going stale, and enabling valuable solutions to be production ready. In addition, common practices and guidelines are established for building secure, ethics-complaint AI solutions. 8 No two Cloud COEs are quite the same. Data science skills are an important part of the picture. However, as the level of maturity deepens and the focus of the Cloud COE evolves, it can make increasing sense to establish a distinct advanced analytics capability. You can read more about what makes an effective Cloud COE in this whitepaper.17 Organizationally, the centralized advanced analytics team with technical ML skills starts to work smoothly in conjunction with various functional teams with specialized domain expertise. Transformational Characteristics Organizations at the transformational phase are actively using AI to stimulate innovation, to support agility, and to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is ongoing. Models are built and deployed from a unified ML platform, making ML accessible to everyone in the organization. At this phase, organizations typically model a hybrid approach to AI, with functional or product-specific AI teams embedded into the broader product teams — supported by the advanced analytics team, which might become its own hub or center of excellence. The central team enables a mechanism for scaling and cultivating these capabilities across the organization: for example, implementing a mechanism for secondment or talent rotation, whereby business or product experts are immersed in ML techniques to learn hands-on. Over time, ML expertise diffuses across lines of business. The role of the centralized advanced analytics team becomes more confined to establishing common patterns and best practices and to providing standard tools and libraries for accelerating ML projects. By contrast, the data science teams embedded in product groups or lines of business are responsible for building their function-specific ML models. This division of responsibility drives consistency in building high-quality, technical solutions with real business impact. All teams are empowered through a platform that enables access to useful datasets, prepared features, reusable components, and trained models. That platform is supported by scalable and serverless compute for batch and online data ingestion and processing, distributed ML training and serving, access to databases with specialized storage and querying capabilities, and hardware accelerators. 18 Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from focusing on best practices, ensuring that AI practices are responsible, that they are based on sound principles, and that AI systems are safe and robust. The ML platform is supported with tools for continuous integration, continuous training, and continuous model serving and monitoring. Building and maintaining such a platform is a shared responsibility between ML and software engineers with skills in infrastructure, DevOps, and SRE. Organizations in this phase often assemble teams to conduct cutting-edge research and present at academic conferences and AI events. To do this, they focus their research and innovation in areas where they have unique capabilities, either in terms of domain understanding or data availability, so that they can build a sustainable advantage over time. Besides the competitive edge that such a sustainable advantage provides, the in-house research capabilities can add to an organization’s employee value proposition, becoming a point of differentiation to attract the best talent.19 Google Cloud smart analytics and AI Google Cloud offers a wide set of products that enable organizations to accelerate their AI journey, ranging from ready-to-use AI services to an integrated data science development environment for building custom solutions.

Tactical maturity Learning about data science and ML is self-motivated by a few members of your IT and data teams, using publicy available online resources. While this approach is useful for developing technical skills around AI and ML in general, the training courses don’t follow a planned learning path that is aligned with your organization's current and future needs. Meanwhile, a few members may be working on ML prototypes, but when faced with a compelling use case where ML is needed, your organization tends to turn to third-party consultants, rather than hiring to fill the skill set gaps in-house. Strategic maturity You’re starting to build greater AI capability in-house by hiring the required data science and ML engineering skills. As there are plenty of job titles and descriptions in the field of ML,9 1 your focus is on the skills and seniority levels that the organization needs. 9 For a breakdown of the top 10 role profiles needed in a data science team, see this article from Google’s Head of Decision Intelligence. The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the six AI maturity themes in terms of the three AI maturity phases — where each phase is descriptive of how a given organization is currently functioning in that theme — you get the AI Maturity Scale. In each of the themes, you can see what happens when an organization moves from experimenting with ML tools and technologies, to working with them more strategically, to building a transformational AI capability. Bridging People and Technology, “Learn” concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire outside talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners.21 To ensure that your team is well qualified to use the necessary tools and technology, you’re developing clear learning paths with certifications and aligning those paths with your organization’s priority use cases. You’ve recognized that the field of AI is constantly changing, and you keep up with those changes by following relevant events, conferences, and experts in the field. You strive to do this systematically, providing employees with training opportunities and requirements to fulfill. In addition, you choose a strategic partner for advisory, consultation, and program management, someone who also provides specialized knowledge in specific AI and ML use cases (for example, chatbots and conversational apps). You use partnerships to help accelerate your AI adoption by taking advantage of best practices and other organizational lessons that experienced AI and ML subject matter experts bring to the table. Transformational maturity You aim to head-hunt well-known AI and ML talent to lead increasing research and innovation efforts — while also gaining a greater reputation for effective talent development. Both industry expertise (like finance, healthcare, telco) and domain expertise (churn prediction, credit risk assessment, medical diagnostics) become increasingly important for hiring great candidates. This talent and experience is essential for solving groundbreaking domain- specific problems with AI. For learning and development, you encourage peer-to-peer and community learning, creating an internal knowledge base, wikis, and tailored courses and learning tracks. You also organize internal conferences to showcase AI applications and promote knowledge sharing. Enabling rotations across business functions ensures not only tighter collaboration between members of different teams, but also an exchange of experience and learning on the job. This mechanism for diffusing and developing talent across your organization can become part of your employee value proposition, helping to attract the best talent. This can, in turn, help start a virtuous talent cycle. At this maturity phase, a partnership can evolve to become a co-creation relationship, where both you and your partners' ML researchers and engineers work together to break new ground and solve cutting-edge problems in the field. Such research also becomes part of your value proposition for employees, and a competitive advantage in the market.22 Lead An organization’s maturity in the Lead theme reflects the effectiveness with which that organization will adopt AI in line with business priorities. Tactical maturity AI adoption is driven across your organization by individual contributors or a manager within one project team, with little or no executive sponsorship. There is typically limited collaboration between data scientists in different teams, and there is often an unclear line of sight between ML initiatives and the organization’s strategic goals. You’re identifying the right use cases for applying ML and also pursuing executive sponsorship. The focus is to explore the power and prove the value of ML to stakeholders, while the funding is part of the project team’s budget. Bridging People and Process, “Lead” concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross- functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. The first successful use case The first step to realizing value from AI is to identify the right business problem and a sponsor committed to using AI to solve that problem. To ensure alignment, start with your organization’s business strategy and key priorities. Identify the right business priority use cases to address with AI, and find the senior executive to own it. Work with their team to get their buy-in and sponsorship. AI projects are more likely to be successful when they have a senior executive sponsor who will champion them with other leaders in your organization.23 Strategic maturity Your senior executives support AI capabilities and projects to deliver value to several business functions, an approach that amounts to a competitive advantage. You’ve begun to establish a mechanism for standardizing practices and guidelines and sharing accumulated knowledge. To accomplish this, you may have put into place a centralized advanced analytics team, with a dedicated budget established by a set of C-level executives with a technology agenda. The advanced analytics team works on delivering prioritized projects or short-term consulting to other teams. In addition, they proactively evangelize and advocate their AI capabilities to other lines of business, clarifying how AI can address the various use cases. What members of this team all share is a forward-thinking and self-motivated interest in using AI to deliver business value. Equally important, they share an understanding of the importance of scaling this impact by growing and embedding data science capabilities in functional teams across the business. Transformational maturity Each functional team has its own data scientists with the right domain-specific expertise and support from a technical project manager with the right organizational influence. This ensures that models can be successfully deployed and scaled in a timely manner. This team is supported by a centralized advanced analytics team, which provides standards and best practices, as well as the tooling and platform for implementing ML projects. Having both a centralized team and embedded data scientists in the business functions ensures technical standards and business alignment, respectively. With standards firmly in place, and the structure to support further investigation, research and innovation activities flourish. This work is sponsored by senior executives both to solve cutting-edge business problems and to establish the organization’s name as a market leader.\", \"Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework Contents Creating value through AI, every step of the way Part 1: Executive summary The power of AI ................................................................................................................... 4 Leveraging the power of AI ............................................................................................. 5 The AI maturity themes The AI maturity phases The AI Maturity Scale Putting it all together Next steps ........................................................................................................................... 12 Find out more Work with Google experts Part 2: Technical deep-dive The AI maturity phases ................................................................................................... 14 Tactical Strategic Transformational The AI Maturity Scale ...................................................................................................... 20 Learn Lead Access Scale Secure Automate Additional technical resources .................................................................................... 351 Creating value through AI, every step of the way Companies everywhere are seeking to leverage the power of AI. And rightly so. The smart applications of AI enable organizations to improve, to scale, and to accelerate the decision-making process across most business functions, so as to work both more efficiently and more effectively. It can also open up new avenues and new revenue streams, providing the organization with an additional competitive edge. In short, many believe (as we do) that the enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions today are positioning themselves to be the global economic leaders of tomorrow. But the path to building an effective AI capability is not an easy one. There are many challenges to overcome. Challenges with the technology to develop platforms and solutions. With the people who will implement and manage that technology. With the data that fuels the technology. And with the processes that govern the whole of it. How do you harness the power inherent in AI, while avoiding any potential missteps? That’s where Google Cloud comes in. Our framework for AI adoption provides a guide to technology leaders who want to build an effective AI capability, one that enables them to leverage the power of AI to enhance and streamline their business, smoothly and smartly. The framework is informed by Google’s own evolution, innovation, and leadership in AI, including experience deploying AI in production through products such as Gmail and Google Photos. It is also inspired by many years of experience helping cloud customers1 — from startups to enterprises, in various industries — to solve complex challenges.2 1 Google Cloud Customer Voices Digital Book 2019. 2 Google Cloud named a leader in The Forrester New Wave™: Computer Vision Platforms, Q4 2019. Recent advances in technology are making AI more versatile — and all but indispensableWith Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, you’ll be able to create and evolve your own transformative AI capability. You’ll have a map for assessing where you are in the journey and where, at the end of it, you’d like to be. You’ll have a structure for building scalable AI capabilities to create better insights from big data with powerful algorithms across the entire business. With Google Cloud as your guide, the path to AI is considerably smoother. 2Executive summary Part 1: 4 The power of AI New ideas are brought to market daily — some from established companies equipped with industry experience and capital, some from new companies armed with new technologies and a desire to disrupt. What often bridges the gap between plans and outcomes is a company’s ability to effectively make data-driven decisions and execute at scale. This is precisely what artificial intelligence with machine learning (ML)3 1 can do for the companies that know how to take that information and use it well. Machine learning is particularly adept at finding patterns in complex datasets to solve complex problems, including perceptual tasks, such as visual perception and speech recognition. The use cases are both wide reaching and dynamic. Manufacturers, for example, are streamlining their capital expenses by implementing predictive maintenance. Financial institutions are enhancing their risk analysis. Retailers and media providers are personalizing their customer experience. And the travel industry is offering their customers dynamic pricing predictions. At the same time, academic and industrial advances in AI have resulted in better tooling, smarter algorithms, and more effective implementation techniques covering a wide range of use cases and datasets. These advances — combined with exponential gains in the cost of data storage, compute power, AI-centric hardware, and cloud computing — have democratized AI for industry in an unprecedented way. AI and ML are increasingly implicated in companies gaining a competitive edge, with direct and attributable business value. In a research study we conducted in partnership with MIT Technology Review,4 2 we found that the adoption of ML results in 2x more data-driven decisions, 5x faster decision-making, and 3x faster execution. Enterprises that invest in building industry-specific AI solutions are proven to be better positioned as future global economic leaders. By 2030, companies that fully absorb AI could double their cash flow.5 3 Machine learning truly is reshaping the marketplace. 3 Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. Machine learning is an effective way for building AI systems through automatically discovering useful patterns from data, rather than feeding human-writ- ten rules to the system. 4 Machine Learning: The New Proving Ground for Competitive Advantage. 5 Notes from the AI frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy, McKinsey & Company, September 2018.5 Leveraging the power of AI How do you structure your teams for success? How can you create, discover, share, and manage data assets? How can you leverage native cloud technologies to scale AI? How do you streamline the process of updating and monitoring your ML models in production? We have a solution for that. The AI maturity themes Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework is anchored in the familiar rubric of people, process, technology, and data. The interplay between these four key areas gives rise to six themes: Learn, Lead, Access, Scale, Automate, and Secure. These themes are foundational to the AI Adoption Framework. Figure 1: The AI maturity themes6 Each of the themes draws its character from the two areas it bridges: Learn concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire external talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners. What data and ML skill sets are required in the organization? What data science and engineering roles should be hired? To what extent do learning plans reflect business needs? What is the nature of the partnership with AI third parties? Lead concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross-functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. How are the teams structured? Do they have executive sponsorship and empowerment? How are AI projects budgeted, governed, assessed? Access concerns the extent to which your organization recognizes data management as a key element to enable AI and the degree to which data scientists can share, discover, and reuse data and other ML artifacts. How is the dataset created, curated, and annotated? Who owns the dataset? Is it discoverable and reusable? Can you share, reuse, and expand trained models, notebooks, and other ML components and solutions?7 Scale concerns the extent to which you use cloud-native ML services that scale with large amounts of data and large numbers of data processing and ML jobs, with reduced operational overhead. How are cloud-based services provisioned? Are they on demand or long- living? How is capacity for workloads allocated? Secure concerns the extent to which you understand and protect your data and ML services from unauthorized and inappropriate access, in addition to ensuring responsible and explainable AI. What controls are in place? What strategies govern the whole? How does an organization establish trust in its AI capabilities so that it is leveraged to drive business value? Automate concerns the extent to which you are able to deploy, execute, and operate technology for data processing and ML pipelines in production efficiently, frequently, and reliably. What triggers a process? How do you track data lineage? Are your pipelines fault tolerant and resumable? How do you manage logging, monitoring, and notifications? 8 The AI maturity phases Your readiness for success in adopting AI in your business is determined by your current business practices in each of these six themes. For each theme, those practices will fall into one of the following phases: Tactical: Simple use cases for AI are in place, but they are typically short-term and narrow. There may be no coherent plan with a strategy for building out to the future. The focus is on easy adoption, minimal disruption, and quick wins. Strategic: AI is now used to deliver sustainable business value for the organization, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production, leveraging both ready-to-use and custom models. A broader vision governs AI adoption. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a special few. Perception starts to move beyond the hype, becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. Transformational: AI plays a key role in the organization: stimulating innovation, supporting agility, and helping to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is continuous and encouraged. ML expertise has diffused across lines of business. There is a mechanism in place for scaling and promoting ML capabilities across the organization. 9 The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the AI maturity themes in light of the three phases, the result is the AI Maturity Scale. Self-motivated, isolated learning using online resources Third parties cover the skills gap in the organization No hiring for ML skills AI adoption driven by individual contributors “Heroic” project manager with team budget AI/ML link to business goals not always clear Hiring data science and ML skills Organizing structured and continuous training programs Strategic partner selected to provide consulting and specialized knowledge Creating a centralized cross- functional advanced analytics team to establish common ML patterns and practices Senior executive sponsorship and dedicated budget by C-level for innovative projects Aligning AI efforts with business objectives and priorities Learning by embedding data scientists to the business function teams Hiring data science and ML talent for innovation with industry expertise Partnering to innovate, co-create, and augment technical resources Endorsement and dedicated budget within each line of business Function-specific data science teams with domain expertise, in addition to the centralized advanced analytics team Innovation and research teams No asset sharing Isolated data islands Building a data lake Managing an enterprise data warehouse Defining and sharing a unified data model Centralized data and ML asset management Discovering, sharing, and reusing datasets and AI assets Standardized ML feature stores and datasets Encouraging contributions from across the organization10 Dedicated hardware for cost control Working with a limited number of small datasets Implementing private networks with primitive IAM accessed and managed by a dedicated team Ensuring privacy through sensitive data classification and obfuscation Enabling data protection through encryption Using a fully managed serverless data warehouse for ad hoc querying and data exploration Using fully managed serverless data services for ingestion and processing Using fully managed serverless ML services for training and prediction serving Implementing principle of least privilege Exploring explainable AI techniques Investing in establishing AI ethics Operating an integrated ML experimentation and production platform Using specialized ML accelerators (GPUs, TPUs) on demand Orchestrating end-to-end data and ML pipelines IAM continuously monitored and improved Considering AI safety and robustness Developing fair ML systems Ad hoc, manual data processing and ML model training and serving High-risk changes reviewed and deployed infrequently and manually Automating (scheduled and event-driven) data pipelines Automating ML training and batch-prediction pipelines Managing logging, monitoring, and notifications Implementing ML training pipelines with continuous integration and delivery Implementing ML prediction services with continuous integration and delivery Managing ML model registry, ML metadata, and ML artifacts11 In each of the themes, you can see what happens when you move from adopting AI approaches ad hoc, to working with them more and more comprehensively across the organization — which means deeper and more consistent training for your people, which in turn means streamlined and updated processes, which in turn drives collaboration and, in time, innovation. The organization transforms. When AI has been integrated into all parts of your organization, then you are fully harnessing the power it offers to transform your position in the industry. But at every step along the way, adding in effective AI capabilities brings benefits. Putting it all together And that’s the essence of the framework that Google Cloud uses to guide customers successfully through the process of adopting AI in their organization. With the framework, you can assess your organization’s AI maturity and determine what you’ll need to bridge the gap to where you’d like to be. While we touch on the Google Cloud products, you can use this information however you would like: the framework is technology agnostic. We’re here to offer further guidance, if that alignment dovetails with your vision. We’ve worked hard to make AI accessible to all, not only ML researchers and engineers, but to a vast array of customers across industries as well. And our ongoing work in tooling, frameworks, datasets, and models is well documented in the open source community. AI and ML are central to who we are. Whether or not we accompany you on the journey, however, our framework can help you find your way, from your initial changes all the way to becoming fully AI-powered. 12 Next steps Find out more To dive more deeply into the details of Google Cloud’s AI Adoption Framework, see Part 2 of this paper.

Each organization’s current approaches to AI will fall within one of these three phases. Each phase offers opportunities for further exploration and development. Tactical Characteristics Organizations at the tactical phase are exploring the potential of AI to deliver in the short term. Use cases tend to be narrow, and developers are typically leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) tools and ready-to-use AI and ML services for proofs of concept and prototyping, for example, using a prebuilt computer vision service to detect printed and handwritten text, or using descriptive analytics to create a customer segmentation model. At this phase, organizations are aware of the promise of advanced analytics,6 1 but ML can be seen as unattainable, and for this reason, complex problems are outsourced. Since the ML projects that exist do so through individual efforts, those projects might not be aligned with the organization’s business goals, and so even the most successfully deployed ML projects may have only limited business impact. At this phase, too, there may be no process to scale solutions consistency, nor the skill set to solve complex analytics problems. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from better access to data. Integrated, cleaner, and fresher data leads, in turn, to actionable insights better tailored to your needs, which translates to sharper and more informed decision-making. Such swift improvement is immediately validating, and can help to paint a picture for stakeholders of the power of ML. 6 Broadly, we think of advanced analytics as the ability to use data science and machine learning to create insight for more effective decision-making. 15 Organizations at this phase should look to develop the foundational skill set for core data wrangling and descriptive analytics. To drive effective collaboration across an organization and to innovate with data from many sources, a key next move is to start bringing together siloed data from the many lines of business into a central, unified data lake, but with decentralized access. With a central data lake, it’s easier to derive insights from unstructured data and easier also to perform batch integration for reporting. Data is available through centralized tooling, but teams do not lose autonomy of access management or data ownership. Organizations at this phase can benefit, too, from the move toward use cases that are feasible and designed to deliver business value, but that begin to tackle increasingly complex problems. And the quality of the analytics solutions improves when the organization focuses on developing core standards: • A set of unified standards and technical practices that ensures the security of all data access and protection • A set of common principles and procedures that prevents building any ML that may harm your brand (such as, for example, inadvertently building socially biased models) Strategic Characteristics Organizations at the strategic phase are focused on delivering sustainable business value, with several ML systems deployed and maintained in production that leverage both ready-to- use and custom models. ML is no longer seen as the domain of a select few, but is instead in the process of becoming a pivotal accelerator for the business. At this phase, organizations typically require a degree of centralized coordination and so they will often create an advanced analytics7 1 team with the right skill set to build solutions for various ML use cases across business functions. This team can be part of a broader Cloud 7 A centralized team, spun out from the core Cloud COE. This team should have engineering skills in data, analytics, and ML; and they should operate as the hub in a hub-and-spoke pattern, working closely with other ML and data science teams in the various lines of business.16 Center of Excellence (COE),8 1 where engineers and data scientists with domain expertise work side by side, drawing on business subject matter experts, as required by the use case. The centralized team aims to achieve several strategic goals: • To ensure consistent standards and governance • To assess the feasibility of new use cases • To weigh in on new data collection • To remain current on which products can be bought rather than built • To help build ML solutions for different product teams • To prioritize scarce ML resources around key business problems As the surrounding organizational fabric matures (for example, increased awareness of AI capabilities, increasing demand for utilizing those capabilities, increased consistency of tooling and approach), it is more feasible for ML to be used independently in different products and business areas. At this phase, teams have skills in data wrangling and descriptive and predictive analytics; they use existing frameworks, methods, and techniques to solve a variety of use cases; and they often deploy custom ML models in production. Teams retrieve their information from a single source: an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), with complete, consistent, correct, and concurrent data. Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT) routines are automated and scalable. Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from developing an AI capability that is more tailored to their business model and their distinct business needs. And from adding automated processes to their customized models. Technically, the next key moves are about protecting data quality, preventing ML models from going stale, and enabling valuable solutions to be production ready. In addition, common practices and guidelines are established for building secure, ethics-complaint AI solutions. 8 No two Cloud COEs are quite the same. Data science skills are an important part of the picture. However, as the level of maturity deepens and the focus of the Cloud COE evolves, it can make increasing sense to establish a distinct advanced analytics capability. You can read more about what makes an effective Cloud COE in this whitepaper.17 Organizationally, the centralized advanced analytics team with technical ML skills starts to work smoothly in conjunction with various functional teams with specialized domain expertise. Transformational Characteristics Organizations at the transformational phase are actively using AI to stimulate innovation, to support agility, and to cultivate a culture where experimentation and learning is ongoing. Models are built and deployed from a unified ML platform, making ML accessible to everyone in the organization. At this phase, organizations typically model a hybrid approach to AI, with functional or product-specific AI teams embedded into the broader product teams — supported by the advanced analytics team, which might become its own hub or center of excellence. The central team enables a mechanism for scaling and cultivating these capabilities across the organization: for example, implementing a mechanism for secondment or talent rotation, whereby business or product experts are immersed in ML techniques to learn hands-on. Over time, ML expertise diffuses across lines of business. The role of the centralized advanced analytics team becomes more confined to establishing common patterns and best practices and to providing standard tools and libraries for accelerating ML projects. By contrast, the data science teams embedded in product groups or lines of business are responsible for building their function-specific ML models. This division of responsibility drives consistency in building high-quality, technical solutions with real business impact. All teams are empowered through a platform that enables access to useful datasets, prepared features, reusable components, and trained models. That platform is supported by scalable and serverless compute for batch and online data ingestion and processing, distributed ML training and serving, access to databases with specialized storage and querying capabilities, and hardware accelerators. 18 Opportunities for growth and advancement At this phase, organizations can benefit substantially from focusing on best practices, ensuring that AI practices are responsible, that they are based on sound principles, and that AI systems are safe and robust. The ML platform is supported with tools for continuous integration, continuous training, and continuous model serving and monitoring. Building and maintaining such a platform is a shared responsibility between ML and software engineers with skills in infrastructure, DevOps, and SRE. Organizations in this phase often assemble teams to conduct cutting-edge research and present at academic conferences and AI events. To do this, they focus their research and innovation in areas where they have unique capabilities, either in terms of domain understanding or data availability, so that they can build a sustainable advantage over time. Besides the competitive edge that such a sustainable advantage provides, the in-house research capabilities can add to an organization’s employee value proposition, becoming a point of differentiation to attract the best talent.19 Google Cloud smart analytics and AI Google Cloud offers a wide set of products that enable organizations to accelerate their AI journey, ranging from ready-to-use AI services to an integrated data science development environment for building custom solutions.

Tactical maturity Learning about data science and ML is self-motivated by a few members of your IT and data teams, using publicy available online resources. While this approach is useful for developing technical skills around AI and ML in general, the training courses don’t follow a planned learning path that is aligned with your organization's current and future needs. Meanwhile, a few members may be working on ML prototypes, but when faced with a compelling use case where ML is needed, your organization tends to turn to third-party consultants, rather than hiring to fill the skill set gaps in-house. Strategic maturity You’re starting to build greater AI capability in-house by hiring the required data science and ML engineering skills. As there are plenty of job titles and descriptions in the field of ML,9 1 your focus is on the skills and seniority levels that the organization needs. 9 For a breakdown of the top 10 role profiles needed in a data science team, see this article from Google’s Head of Decision Intelligence. The AI Maturity Scale When you evaluate the six AI maturity themes in terms of the three AI maturity phases — where each phase is descriptive of how a given organization is currently functioning in that theme — you get the AI Maturity Scale. In each of the themes, you can see what happens when an organization moves from experimenting with ML tools and technologies, to working with them more strategically, to building a transformational AI capability. Bridging People and Technology, “Learn” concerns the quality and scale of learning programs to upskill your staff, hire outside talent, and augment your data science and ML engineering staff with experienced partners.21 To ensure that your team is well qualified to use the necessary tools and technology, you’re developing clear learning paths with certifications and aligning those paths with your organization’s priority use cases. You’ve recognized that the field of AI is constantly changing, and you keep up with those changes by following relevant events, conferences, and experts in the field. You strive to do this systematically, providing employees with training opportunities and requirements to fulfill. In addition, you choose a strategic partner for advisory, consultation, and program management, someone who also provides specialized knowledge in specific AI and ML use cases (for example, chatbots and conversational apps). You use partnerships to help accelerate your AI adoption by taking advantage of best practices and other organizational lessons that experienced AI and ML subject matter experts bring to the table. Transformational maturity You aim to head-hunt well-known AI and ML talent to lead increasing research and innovation efforts — while also gaining a greater reputation for effective talent development. Both industry expertise (like finance, healthcare, telco) and domain expertise (churn prediction, credit risk assessment, medical diagnostics) become increasingly important for hiring great candidates. This talent and experience is essential for solving groundbreaking domain- specific problems with AI. For learning and development, you encourage peer-to-peer and community learning, creating an internal knowledge base, wikis, and tailored courses and learning tracks. You also organize internal conferences to showcase AI applications and promote knowledge sharing. Enabling rotations across business functions ensures not only tighter collaboration between members of different teams, but also an exchange of experience and learning on the job. This mechanism for diffusing and developing talent across your organization can become part of your employee value proposition, helping to attract the best talent. This can, in turn, help start a virtuous talent cycle. At this maturity phase, a partnership can evolve to become a co-creation relationship, where both you and your partners' ML researchers and engineers work together to break new ground and solve cutting-edge problems in the field. Such research also becomes part of your value proposition for employees, and a competitive advantage in the market.22 Lead An organization’s maturity in the Lead theme reflects the effectiveness with which that organization will adopt AI in line with business priorities. Tactical maturity AI adoption is driven across your organization by individual contributors or a manager within one project team, with little or no executive sponsorship. There is typically limited collaboration between data scientists in different teams, and there is often an unclear line of sight between ML initiatives and the organization’s strategic goals. You’re identifying the right use cases for applying ML and also pursuing executive sponsorship. The focus is to explore the power and prove the value of ML to stakeholders, while the funding is part of the project team’s budget. Bridging People and Process, “Lead” concerns the extent to which your data scientists are supported by a mandate from leadership to apply ML to business use cases, and the degree to which the data scientists are cross- functional, collaborative, and self-motivated. The first successful use case The first step to realizing value from AI is to identify the right business problem and a sponsor committed to using AI to solve that problem. To ensure alignment, start with your organization’s business strategy and key priorities. Identify the right business priority use cases to address with AI, and find the senior executive to own it. Work with their team to get their buy-in and sponsorship. AI projects are more likely to be successful when they have a senior executive sponsor who will champion them with other leaders in your organization.23 Strategic maturity Your senior executives support AI capabilities and projects to deliver value to several business functions, an approach that amounts to a competitive advantage. You’ve begun to establish a mechanism for standardizing practices and guidelines and sharing accumulated knowledge. To accomplish this, you may have put into place a centralized advanced analytics team, with a dedicated budget established by a set of C-level executives with a technology agenda. The advanced analytics team works on delivering prioritized projects or short-term consulting to other teams. In addition, they proactively evangelize and advocate their AI capabilities to other lines of business, clarifying how AI can address the various use cases. What members of this team all share is a forward-thinking and self-motivated interest in using AI to deliver business value. Equally important, they share an understanding of the importance of scaling this impact by growing and embedding data science capabilities in functional teams across the business. Transformational maturity Each functional team has its own data scientists with the right domain-specific expertise and support from a technical project manager with the right organizational influence. This ensures that models can be successfully deployed and scaled in a timely manner. This team is supported by a centralized advanced analytics team, which provides standards and best practices, as well as the tooling and platform for implementing ML projects. Having both a centralized team and embedded data scientists in the business functions ensures technical standards and business alignment, respectively. With standards firmly in place, and the structure to support further investigation, research and innovation activities flourish. This work is sponsored by senior executives both to solve cutting-edge business problems and to establish the organization’s name as a market leader. In addition, to stimulate innovation, you facilitate competitions that reward employees for sharing ideas on how ML can solve key problems.24 Your C-level executives act passionately, continuously demonstrating active sponsorship for AI projects and encouraging contributions from across the organization. The leadership functions effectively for an AI-driven environment, fostering a culture of blamelessness and open communication channels, where sharing failures openly is encouraged and mistakes are treated as opportunities for improvement. Experimentation drives innovation and market success. Teams are free to try out many different ideas with the goal of failing faster, failing better, and learning from the experience to improve and innovate. Access An organization’s maturity in the Access theme reflects that organization’s ability both to accelerate an ML project and to improve the adoption of the AI capabilities across different teams and functions. Tactical maturity Each team usually manages its own data island and ML assets,10 1 with no sharing among other teams. Even within the same team, it might not be possible to reuse assets, as the technology and processes have not been standardized yet. In a bid to update your data management and access strategy, you are looking into building a unified data lake, containing the raw (structured and unstructured) data feeds, for example, using Cloud Storage. This data lake can then form the foundation for collecting, curating, and sharing data across the organization, that is, for building managed information stores. Strategic maturity You recognize data as a vital enterprise asset that fuels AI, and so you’ve improved both the utilization and the management of data, working to keep it safe and useful. You likely have invested in an EDW, which provides a unified data model, with an integrated, consistent information store for various business functions. You have also made data quality management a business priority to ensure the right foundation for analytics and AI. The EDW, which can be implemented using BigQuery, empowers data analysts in their reporting, data scientists in their exploratory data analysis and ML experimentation tasks, and other business intelligence (BI) activities.\"]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:tornado.access:429 POST /v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?%24alt=json%3Benum-encoding%3Dint
